Estimation of change points and model selection via generalized BIC and other criteria

\usage{
jumpoints(y, x, k = min(30, round(length(y)/10)), output = "2", 
    psi = NULL, round = TRUE, control = fit.control(), 
    selection = sel.control(), ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
the observed (genomic) sequence supposed to have a piecewise constant mean function.
}
  \item{x}{
the `segmented' variable, e.g. the genomic location. If missing simple indices 1,2,... are assumed.
}
  \item{k}{
the starting number of changepoints. It should be quite larger than the supposed number of 
(true) changepoints. This argument is ignored if starting values of the changepoints are specified via
\code{psi}.
}
  \item{output}{
which output should be produced? Possible values are \code{"1"}, \code{"2"}, or \code{"3"}; see Details
}
  \item{psi}{
numeric vector to indicate the starting values for the changepoints. When \code{psi=NULL} (default), \code{k} 
  quantiles are assumed.
}
  \item{round}{
logical; should the values of the changepoints be rounded?
}
  \item{control}{
a list returned by \code{fit.control}
}
  \item{selection}{
a list returned by \code{sel.control}
}
  \item{\dots}{
additional arguments..
}
}
\details{
The algorithm works by suitably transforming the observed responses to fit a continuous piecewise linear model.
A large number of changepoints is first estimated and afterward the appropriate number of changepoints is 
selected via a specified criterion (e.g. BIC, MDL, ..). At this aim the lars algorithm is employed. 
}
\value{
A list including several components depending on the value of \code{output} \cr

If \code{output="1"} the most relevant components are 
\item{fitted.values }{the fitted values}
\item{n.psi}{the estimated number of changepoints}
\item{est.means}{the estimated means}
\item{psi}{the estimated changepoints}\cr

If \code{output="2"} the most relevant components are 
\item{fitted.values }{the fitted values}
\item{n.psi}{the estimated number of changepoints}
\item{criterion}{the values of the selection criterion}
\item{psi}{the estimated changepoints}
\item{est.means}{the estimated means}
\item{psi0}{the estimated changepoints at ouput 1 (before applying the selection criterion)}
\item{est.means0}{the estimated means at ouput 1 (before applying the selection criterion)}\cr

If \code{output="3"} the most relevant components are those of output 2 but
\item{psi0}{the estimated changepoints at ouput 1}
\item{psi1}{the estimated changepoints at ouput 2}
\item{psi}{the estimated changepoints at ouput 3 (after applying again the segmented algorithm).}
